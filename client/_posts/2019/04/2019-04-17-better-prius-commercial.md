description: If I had to make a commercial for the Toyota Prius, this is the commercial I would make.
---
A few years ago Toyota ran some Prius ads involving a bank robbery and a police chase. Essentially, the bank robbers' car gets towed during the robbery so they jump in a Prius. A police chase ensues, but the Prius is too fast for the police to catch the robbers. I think the idea was to humorously convince people that the Prius is undeserving of its poor reputation. However, I didn't think that the commercial was funny and it seemed pretty bland.

I think that if Toyota had wanted to showcase the driving, handling, and speed of the Prius, they should have asked the pros to do it. That's right, they should have collaborated with the Fast and the Furious (FF) franchise to make their commercial. I don't think a FF movie came out the year the ad aired, so maybe they could have held off a year so that the ad coincided with a FF movie. Regardless, here is what my pitch for the Prius commercial would have been.

We would start off with the FF cast drag racing. Someone with messy hair and shades would then show up in a Prius. Said mystery man in a Prius would race against someone from the FF. During the race, the wind would blow the wig off the man (his window will be down) and it would be revealed that it is actually Vin Diesel's character driving the Prius. The tag line "Secretly Fast, Secretly Furious" would show up on the screen and then we would see all the cast of FF speeding down the road, each in a Prius.

I think my version would work because
 * A lot of people know the Fast and the Furious franchise
 * FF is associated with desirable cars
 * The reveal that Vin Diesel is driving the Prius is unexpected
 * The tag line helps guide the viewer to the realization that there is more to the Prius than meets the eye

Now of course I'm sure a commercial collaboration with such a big franchise would not be cheap, but if it helps sell cars then in the end it would be worth it.
