description: A new project I'm working on to practice my 3D skills
---
I've dabbled in 3D for the past few years, but recently I've really been working on improving both my technical and artistic skills. To help keep my motivation up, I decided to start [Models by Mike](https://3d.michaelporter.dev) as a way to share my work and keep generating new ideas of things to create.

Models by Mike makes it easy to share 3D models to Facebook, and I'm also hoping to make them available for Snapchat in the near future. The idea behind the site is to help people add some pizzazz to posts celebrating life events. The first model I made was a [birthday cake with balloons](https://3d.michaelporter.dev/happy-birthday-cake/post/) so that you can easily wish someone a happy birthday on Facebook without blending in with all the "Happy Birthday!" messages that people leave.

It's a fun little project that matches my skill level. There is a decently small file size limit for the 3D models, but that works out for me because I'm not good at creating highly detailed models (yet). And I got to write a new website and put it up on my server.
