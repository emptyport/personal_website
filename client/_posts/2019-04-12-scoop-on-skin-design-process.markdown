I love seeing how things are made, so for this post I thought I'd give a behind-the-scenes look at a logo I made.

To get started, I was given the following sketch and screenshot. The logo is for the "Scoop on Skin" podcast which will be focused on dermatology. The idea was to make a logo that was also some sort of brainteaser.

The "Man Overboard" brainteaser (#2 in the image) caught my eye and I thought that would also make a good layout for the logo. I put together the following three variants and sent it back for review. My software of choice is [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). I tried making the infinity symbol out of the O's all on my own, but I was having some trouble. I came across an awesome tutorial by [Logos By Nick on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9WLZgfr-NQ) and I adapted that to my logo.

Variant C was directly based off the sketch, variant B was based off the "man overboard" brainteaser, and variant A was sort of a combination of the two with the shared "S" and the "scoop" sitting on the "skin."

The client liked variant A the best so then it was time to add some color. I went to their website and pulled out their logo colors. I personally liked color variant D the best, and the client ended up liking it the best too!

Once the color was picked I cleaned things up a tiny bit and then sent the logo off! All in all it ended up being a fairly simple and quick logo design because the client already had an idea in mind.
